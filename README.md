# Magic for WordPress

Magic for WordPress provides Passwordless login for WordPress sites.

## Usage

1. Create an account at https://magic.link
2. Register your app and obtain a Publishable Key
3. Install and activate Magic for WordPress
4. Add your key to Magic for WordPress
5. Update your Redirect URI
6. Add the Magic sign-in form to your site using an HTML tag or Elementor Widget.

## HTML Tag

```
<div id="magic-sign-in"></div>

The above HTML will render the login form for logged out users and display their user profile information if they are logged in. This can be added to any theme or site using the Gutenberg HTML block or using a page builder such as Elementor.
